# Download a File with wget

This guide will walk you through the steps to download a file from a URL using the \`wget\` command.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the \`wget\` command-line tool installed on your system. You can usually install it with your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget
```

## Steps to Download the File

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Copy the following \`wget\` command to download the file:

   ```bash
   wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1aqG_JdJslxw1R8OcFpLjgMYNcjKtCBcg' -O output_file_name
   ```

   Replace \`output_file_name\` with the desired name for the downloaded file.

   For example, to download the file as "1.zip," use:

   ```bash
   wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1aqG_JdJslxw1R8OcFpLjgMYNcjKtCBcg' -O 1.zip
   ```

3. Wait for the download to complete. The file will be saved with the specified name in your current directory.

That's it! You've successfully downloaded the file using the \`wget\` command.
